# discordjs-8ball
A simple Discord.JS 8ball bot.
Just follow the Discord.JS instructions to get everything ready and simply start index.js.
Make sure you have changed your token in index.js, the default prefix is + but you can change it to anything at the top of the code thats also where you can insert your token.
Feel free to use any code from it.
